# the art collector game

In this run and jump game you are an art collector who has to add value to his collection by grabbing the paintings. But make sure you don't knock over the sculptures!

# Inspiration
I wanted the game to appear as if it is being played inside a hand-drawn cartoon. But rather than the classic kaleidoscopic   with a more grown-up feel. So the initial source material came from the widely recognisable language of the New Yorker magazine cartoons heavily influenced by the design of the New Yorker magazineIn terms of game-play it is based on a simplified Super-Mario-style run and jump game.
