# The Art Aollector Game

In this run and jump game you are an art collector who has to add value to his collection by grabbing the paintings. But make sure you don't knock over the sculptures!

# Inspiration

At the outset, I wanted this project to bring my background in the visual arts into contact with the new tools that I was discovering. Hence, the subject matter of this simple game referencing the art market and collecting culture.

Aesthetics-wise, I wanted the game to appear as if it is being played inside a hand-drawn cartoon. Rather than pumping out the kaleidoscopic, rainbow spectrum that we all know from classic arcade games, I wanted it to have a more grown-up feel. But the humor still needed to be a key element. So the natural source material for me came from the widely recognisable language of the New Yorker magazine cartoons. In the characters and the props, I drew particularly from the work of Saul Steinberg who published works in the magazine heavily influenced by the design of the New Yorker magazineIn terms of game-play it is based on a simplified Super-Mario-style run and jump game.
