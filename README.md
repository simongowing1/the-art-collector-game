# The Art Collector Game

In this run and jump game you are an art collector who has to add value to his collection by grabbing the paintings. But make sure you don't knock over the sculptures!

# Inspiration

At the outset, I wanted this project to bring my background in the visual arts into contact with the new tools that I was discovering. Hence, the subject matter of this simple game referencing the art market and collecting culture.

I wanted the game to appear as if it was being played inside a hand-drawn cartoon. Rather than pumping out the kaleidoscopic, rainbow of colours synonymous with classic arcade games, I wanted it to have a more grown-up feel. But the humor still needed to be a key element. The natural source material was the recognisable language of the New Yorker magazine cartoons.

In the character, I drew particularly from the work of Saul Steinberg who first contributed to the magazine in 1941. He is the die-cut capitalist from Steinberg's strips, a Daddy Warbucks type character, which was perfect for my Art Collector.

These were supplemented by excerpts from Ad Reinhardt's 'How to Look at Art' series of cartoons.
